The beach requires at least one lifeguard to be present at all times during the workday.\n\nFarmer John realizes he hired too many lifeguards and needs to fire exactly one. He wants to maximize the total amount of time that is covered by at least one remaining lifeguard after firing one cow.\n\nGiven the shifts of all N lifeguards, determine the maximum amount of time that can be covered if exactly one lifeguard is fired.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe first line contains N, the number of lifeguards.\nThe next N lines each contain two integers A_i and B_i.\n\n## Output Format\n\nA single integer representing the maximum time covered after firing one lifeguard.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100\n- 0 ≤ A_i < B_i ≤ 1000",
