He wants to paint two sections of the fence: one section from A to B, and another from C to D (inclusive on both ends).\n\nDetermine the total length of fence that will be painted. Note that if the sections overlap, the overlapping portion should only be counted once.\n\n## Input Format\n\nFour space-separated integers A, B, C, D representing the two fence sections [A,B] and [C,D].\n\n## Output Format\n\nA single integer representing the total length of painted fence.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- 0 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 100\n- 0 ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 100",
