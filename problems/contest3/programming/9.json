Each word has a known length. She wants to format the words into lines where each line contains at most K characters (not counting spaces).\n\nWords must appear in order and cannot be split. Adjacent words on the same line are separated by a single space, but this space does not count toward the K character limit.\n\nDetermine how many lines are needed to format all the words.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe first line contains N and K.\nThe second line contains N space-separated words.\n\n## Output Format\n\nA single integer representing the number of lines needed.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100\n- 1 ≤ K ≤ 1000\n- Each word length ≤ K",
