A large truck then parked in front of them, blocking some portion of both billboards.\n\nGiven the coordinates of the two billboards and the truck, calculate the total visible (unblocked) area of the two billboards.\n\nEach rectangle is specified by its lower-left corner (x1, y1) and upper-right corner (x2, y2).\n\n## Input Format\n\nThree lines, each containing four integers x1, y1, x2, y2.\n- Line 1: Billboard 1 coordinates\n- Line 2: Billboard 2 coordinates  \n- Line 3: Truck coordinates\n\n## Output Format\n\nA single integer representing the total visible area.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- -1000 ≤ x1 < x2 ≤ 1000\n- -1000 ≤ y1 < y2 ≤ 1000",
